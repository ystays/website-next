If you don't feel like an imposter, you've probably stopped moving forward.

> *Complacency is a classic mistake. Some people get to a certain point and go, “Okay, I’ve figured it out!” Writing isn’t a thing you figure out — ever. My favorite things I’ve ever written, I hate. That might sound like a weird thing to say. But anything I’ve ever written that I felt was really great, I inevitably will look at it two years later and think, “Oh God, this is so amateurish and terrible.” But that’s a good thing. If you ever feel like you’ve solved anything in writing, you’re just setting yourself up for a huge fall — and you’re wrong. Because it’s not math or science; it’s a weird, nebulous, hard-to-define thing.*

And to stay vibrant and successful, you can’t ever feel like you know what you’re doing. Your attitude has to constantly be, “Who is this rank amateur, and how can I teach him how to write?”*

> *'Life is just, like, learning about how to let go about stuff, 'cause like you really can't enjoy things for what they are while you're in it. Like as soon as you're in high school, once you're like, oh, I get high school, you're out of high school. You're, like, once you're like, in your twenties and like, oh I get it, I know ... , you're done. It's all about the experience. ... We're all alone in the end, so it's good. It's, that's the way it has to be.'*

> *'Really?'*

> *'Yeah, I think so. Like, but that's ok. You're alone in the beginning too.'*
