Dribbling is a game of neverending patience. 

As Lao Tzu tells us in Chapter Sixty-Nine of the Tao Te Ching,

> There is a saying among soldiers: <br/>
> I dare not make the first move but would rather play the guest; <br/>
> I dare not advance an inch but would rather withdraw a foot.

Dribbling is to invite the defender to make the first move. 

This is called progressing the ball without appearing to move.

Doing nothing is to have perfect control. Taking the big touch is the loss of perfect control.

When I take a small touch, I bleed a little. When I take the big touch, I die. 

In this battle of attrition, you wear down your opponent by slowly bleeding yourself to death. S/he who moves first dies first, so s/he who dies last will win.[^1]

[^1]: <small>I've been thinking about how I would explain dribbling in football. Here's what I've come up with:</small><br/><small>Dribbling is: small touch, small touch, small touch, then big touch. The small touches are the waiting part, to bait the defender into diving in and making the tackle. After that, the big touch is the reaction to the defender's tackle. If the defender goes left, you go right, and vice versa.</small><br/><small>It bothers me that taking the big touch feels like a significant loss of control. A good defender should make a tackle (if they even decide to do so) immediately after the attacker has taken a big touch, because at that moment the attacker has committed to one direction and no longer has perfect control over the ball. If only small touches are taken, the ball remains very close to the attacker's feet and is virtually impossible to steal.</small><br/><small>It seems jarring when I commit, make that big touch, and then the defender's foot comes in and swipes at the ball. Usually when I dribble the swipe is too late, so I keep the ball and safely make the second touch, but that moment right after the big touch is always a risk. When the swipe happens, the ball is too far from my feet to allow me to change direction again, so I'm forced to hope that the defender's swipe is too late to steal the ball away.</small><br/><small>I'm not sure if there is a better way to dribble. Dribbling is always more risky than making a simple pass, so perhaps this loss of control is unavoidable. You could even say it's exactly that which makes dribbling fun.</small>
