What I look at when I'm evaluating footballers based on the eye test:

1. Body shape when receiving the ball/taking a first touch 
    - receiving with the front foot/back foot, depending on where their opponent is
    - open up your body to the rest of the field, 
    - receive on the half-turn, 
    - take a touch to prevent your passing options being confined to one side of the field (e.g. Van Dijk) 

2. Unpredictability 
    - disguised passing/shots with body shape
    - minimising backlift to reduce time for opponents to react (e.g. toe poke shots in futsal)

3. Positioning and awareness 
    - making runs; overlapping/underlapping runs 
    - dropping into space to receive the ball
    - moving into the half-spaces from the wings, 
    - dribbling without looking at the ball (with your head up)
    - when to dribble/drive forward (when there's space) and when to pass

4. Using their body to shield the ball from opponents
    - the best dribblers know how to place their body in between the ball and the defender
    - take your touch away from a defender and into space

5. Biomechanics. 
    = Do they move efficiently? Aesthetically-pleasing dribblers glide across the field (Messi plays very lightly on the ball of his feet)
