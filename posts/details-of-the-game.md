What I look at when I'm evaluating footballers based on the eye test:

1. Optimal body shape when receiving the ball/taking a first touch 
    - receiving with the front foot/back foot, depending on where their opponent is
    - opening up their body to the rest of the field (e.g. taking a touch to prevent their passing options being confined to one side of the field), 
    - receiving on the half-turn
    - taking their touch away from a defender and into space

2. Unpredictability 
    - disguised passing/shots with body shape
    - minimising backlift to reduce time for opponents to react (e.g. the toe poke in futsal)

3. Positioning and awareness 
    - making runs; overlapping/underlapping runs 
    - dropping into space to receive the ball
    - moving into the half-spaces from the wings or staying wide to maintain width
    - dribbling without looking at the ball (with their head up)
    - knowing when to dribble/drive forward (when there's space) and when to pass

4. Using their body to shield the ball from opponents
    - the best dribblers know how to place their body in between the ball and the defender, which is incredibly effective at compensating for disadvantages in size/height

5. Biomechanics
    - do they move efficiently? Aesthetically-pleasing dribblers glide across the field (e.g. Messi plays very lightly on the ball of his feet)
