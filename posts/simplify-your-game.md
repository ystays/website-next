> "I think of beauty as an absolute necessity. I don’t think it’s a privilege or an indulgence, it’s not even a quest. I think it’s almost like knowledge, which is to say, it’s what we were born for."    
-Toni Morrison

When I was younger. I thought that the most important thing in football and dribbling in particular, was the skills, and I trained for hours every day just to get really good at doing skill moves. And so you know, right from the beginning I've always had an idea of and an aspiration to beauty.

You know, I wanted to play football, that was graceful and elegant and incorporated all these silky skill moves that I saw online. So now you can really see it. And I was very stubborn and obviously very opinionated and, you know, this was how I wanted to play.

I wanted to play with skill moves all the time, literally all the time. And like, every time I got the ball,

But obviously, you know dribbling isn't really about school moves it's about Getting past your opponent, right? And and greatest players, they they refine the dribbling. They don't do anything unnecessary that wastes your energy or effort or time, When they're trying to dribble an opponent.

And so I've had to work really really hard especially because you know I came into the game with such a strong, such a strong perspective on how it should be played. And I've had to work really hard to refine my game and transform my understanding of what beauty looks like.
