> I think of beauty as an absolute necessity. I don’t think it’s a privilege or an indulgence, it’s not even a quest. I think it’s almost like knowledge, which is to say, it’s what we were born for.    

- Toni Morrison

I've played football since I was twelve.

When I was younger, I thought the most important thing in football was dribbling, and the most important thing when dribbling was performing skills. Hence, I trained for hours every day just to master them. I was obsessed with skill moves. 

From the beginning, I already had an idea of how I wanted to play and an aspiration to beauty in my playing style. I wanted to play football that was graceful, elegant, fun, and incorporated all these silky skill moves that I saw online. And I was very stubborn, very uncompromising, and obviously very opinionated that this was how I wanted to play.

You could see this idea when I played, when I would try to perform skill moves every time I got the ball.

Unfortunately, as I slowly came to learn, dribbling isn't really about skill moves; it's about getting past your opponent, right? And the greatest players are the ones that have refined their dribbling and simplified their game. They don't do the unnecessary things that waste their energy, effort or time when trying to get past an opponent.

I came into the game with such a strong opinion on how it should be played, and because of that, I've had to work really, really hard to refine my game and transform my understanding of what beauty looks like.

All of which is not necessarily a bad thing. Many amateur players seem to have no idea how they want to play and no deep understanding of the game. They make bad decisions over and over again, and they never notice it. Without a clear philosophy of how the game should be played according to themselves, they lack personality on the pitch. Their repertoire is a catalog of bad habits.

> What kind of mistake is rushing in to take the ball? What kind of mistake is failing to see the connections before us? They are not identical, but they are cousins. The soccer player rushes in to control the ball; eager to win it he is too aggressive, moving too close too soon, instead of taking his time. By failing to notice what is there, he ends up losing it. Neglecting his body, he hyper-focuses on the ball; eager to master his control of it, he forgets that mastery of the ball is a concern secondary to the mastery of his body. The soccer player does not need a secret revealed, he does not need to control the ball; what he needs is to control himself.
