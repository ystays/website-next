### <u>Takeaways</u>  

<u>Don&apos;t</u>:
1. Make me think! (duh)
2. Let a user spend time thinking - is that an ad or part of the site?

<br/>
<u>3 facts about real-world Web use</u>

 1. We don&apos;t read pages. We scan them. 
    - Web users tend to act like sharks: They have to keep moving, or they&apos;ll die.
 2. We don&apos;t make optimal choices. We satisfice.
    - &quot;... most of the time we *don&apos;t* choose the best option, we choose the *first reasonable option.*&quot;
 3. We don&apos;t figure out how things work. We muddle through.
    - &quot;Faced with any sort of technology, very few people take the time to read instructions.&quot;

<br/>


<u>Krug&apos;s Laws of Usability</u>
1. Don&apos;t make me think!
2. &quot;It doesn&apos;t matter how many times I have to click, as long as each click is a mindless, unambiguous choice.&quot;
3. &quot;Get rid of half the words on each page, then get rid of half of what&apos;s left.&quot;

<br/>
<u>Jakob Nielsen's categories of users</u>
1. Search-dominant
   - These users will look for a search box as soon as they enter a site.
2. Link-dominant
   - These users will browse first, searching only when they have to.

<br/>
<u>The 4 questions the Home page needs to answer when I first enter a new site</u>
1. What is this?
2. What can I do here?
3. What do they have here?
4. Why should I be here - and not somewhere else?

<br/>
<u>The Myth of the Average User</u>
&quot;ALL WEB USERS ARE UNIQUE AND ALL WEB USE IS BASICALLY IDIOSYNCRATIC.&quot;

<br/>
<u>Things that diminish goodwill</u>
Punishing me for not doing things your way.
- I should *never* have to think about formatting data: whether or not to put dashes in my SSN, spaces in my credit card number, or parentheses in my phone number.
