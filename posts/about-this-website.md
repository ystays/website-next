What do I hope for this website?

My hope is for a sense of timelessness. I know this website will fall down the list of my priorities someday, so I hope my posts won't seem too dated even if I haven't been posting regularly.

Lao Tzu: "Work is done, then forgotten. Therefore it lasts forever."

Go forth and do.
