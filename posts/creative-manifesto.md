<br/>
Nothing in this manifesto is true (The name that can be named is not the eternal name).
<br/>
<br/>
<u>Part 1: Inside</u>

1. Do one thing at a time
2. Don't overthink it
3. Write first, edit later

<u>Part 2: Nothing</u>

1. Nothing is original
2. Repetition is a form of change
3. Experience, not philosophy

<u>Part 3: Outside</u>

1. It is not possible to make a mistake
2. Don't be afraid of fun
3. We learn nothing from success

***

<u>Remarks</u>
We want to do one thing at a time; to catch one bird with one stone.

When necessary, abandon unfinished work, but at the right time. (The work is done when you feel it is.)

There is no need to believe or understand anything we say about ourselves or about our art. The truth will imprison us with its expectations.

Today is better than tomorrow. Late is better than never.
