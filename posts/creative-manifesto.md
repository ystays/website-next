<br/>
<u>Part 1: Inside</u>
1. Do one thing at a time
2. Don't overthink it
3. Write first, edit later

<u>Part 2: Nothing</u>
1. Nothing is original
2. Repetition is a form of change
3. Experience, not philosophy

<u>Part 3: Outside</u>
1. It is not possible to make a mistake
2. Don't be afraid of fun
3. Success teaches us nothing

***

<u>Remarks</u>
We want to do one thing at a time; to catch one bird with one stone.

When necessary, abandon unfinished work, but at the right time.
